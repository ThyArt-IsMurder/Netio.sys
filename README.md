    1.  Open Command Prompt as administrator.
    2.  Type the following commands one by one, pressing Enter after each:
        ```cmd
        DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
        DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
        DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
        ```
    3.  Wait for each command to complete.
    4.  Restart your PC.

### 3. Scan for Malware

Malware can cause system instability.

1.  Run a full system scan using your installed antivirus software (e.g., Windows Defender or a third-party solution).
2.  Ensure your antivirus definitions are up to date before scanning.
3.  Remove any threats found and restart your PC.

Ensure your Windows 11 is up to date, as updates can include fixes for known issues.

1.  Go to **Settings** (Win + I).
2.  Click on **Windows Update**.
3.  Click **Check for updates**.
4.  Install any available updates and restart your PC.

### 5. Uninstall Recent Windows Updates (If the problem started recently)

If the BSOD started occurring after a recent Windows update, you might consider uninstalling it.

1.  Go to **Settings** > **Windows Update** > **Update history**.
2.  Scroll down and click on **Uninstall updates**.
3.  Select the most recent update(s) that might have caused the issue and click **Uninstall**.
4.  Restart your PC.

### 6. Run Windows Memory Diagnostic

Faulty RAM can cause `NETIO.SYS` errors.

1.  Type `Windows Memory Diagnostic` in the Windows search bar and open the tool.
2.  Choose **Restart now and check for problems (recommended)**.
